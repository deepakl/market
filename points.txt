Trend formulae
-----4. under current assets, add cash & cash items to marketable securites to get overall cash, compare it to previous years, increase is better
-----5. Compare long-term loans to previous years, decrease is better
-----7. Compare number of outstanding shares (adjusted for splits), decrease is better
-----12. Look at dividend yield, regular dividend paying companies have less money to piss off and the stock price dos not fall as much in a recession.
Helps to stabilize the portfolio
